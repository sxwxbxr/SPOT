# SPOT Feature Overview

## âœ… Implemented Features

- **Blazor WebAssembly dashboard with offline messaging and 3D preview** â€“ The landing page highlights SPOT's offline-first value proposition, renders Spot badges from the shared UI library, and loads a glTF model via Three.js. (apps/web/Spot.Web/Pages/Home.razor)
- **IndexedDB-backed offline queue for client requests** â€“ A C# service wraps the JavaScript interop to persist payloads locally and replay them once connectivity is restored. (apps/web/Spot.Web/Services/IndexedDbStorage.cs, apps/web/Spot.Web/wwwroot/js/indexedDb.js)
- **Three.js integration for WebGL rendering** â€“ A dedicated JavaScript module and the .NET interop surface encapsulate loading and displaying glTF scenes. (apps/web/Spot.Web/Interop/ThreeJs/ThreeJsModule.cs, apps/web/Spot.Web/wwwroot/js/threeInterop.js)
- **ASP.NET Core API foundation** â€“ The server configures CORS, health checks, Swagger UI, and a status endpoint while validating connection-string and OpenSearch options. (apps/server/Spot.Api/Program.cs, apps/server/Spot.Api/Options)
- **Typed client SDK powered by Refit** â€“ Extension methods register a strongly typed `ISpotApi` client that consumes the shared status DTO from the core package. (packages/client-sdk/Spot.ClientSdk, packages/core/Spot.Core/Status)
- **Shared UI and domain building blocks** â€“ The UI package provides reusable components like `SpotBadge`, while the core context exposes project-sync contracts and DTOs. (packages/ui/Spot.UI/Components, packages/core/Spot.Core/Projects)

## ðŸš§ Planned Features

- **EF Core DbContext and seed migrations** to persist project data. (see README.md roadmap)
- **OpenSearch integration plus Microsoft Graph/FileCloud adapters** for richer search and document synchronization. (see README.md roadmap)
- **Expanded offline synchronization** with advanced IndexedDB schemas and orchestration. (see README.md roadmap)
- **Production-ready deployment assets** including hardened Dockerfiles and operational playbooks. (see README.md roadmap)
